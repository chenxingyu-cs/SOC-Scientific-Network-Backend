You would need to know the following configurations:
When running the frontend, run the command:
./activator “run 9068"
When running the backend, run the command:
./activator “run 9069"
And the username and password of the MySQL are both “root"
There should be a database named “enterpriseKG"
Then every thing would be done by the Play
